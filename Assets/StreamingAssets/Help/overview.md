**<color=#FFD700>HOW TO USE</color>**  
- After selecting a category the sections will be listed in the left panel that you can select to access the information  
- While in a category you can type a keyword into the keyword search bar, directly above the left panel, and use arrow keys to iterate to each instance of the keyword  
- Sections in a category highlighted with a blue background are sub-categories that can be accessed for information about that subject  
- The home button in the top right will appear if you leave the home page, you can use this button to return to the home screen at any time  
- You can type in any specific job number, example: y231, and be taken to the page with information that has to do with that particular job  
- Images can be selected and manipulated by using the + and - buttons to zoom in or out and move the picture with your finger to get a closer look at the terrain  
- Operating notes will eventually be included for each so that we know what to expect for any given job, this is constantly being updated  

**<color=#FFD700>CONCEPT</color>**  

- A mobile guide for rail employees that explains each job, demonstrates everyday use of tools and procedures, and shares real-world operating notes contributed by guys that worked the job  
- A tool for when you receive a call for that job you haven't worked in months, you type in the job number, and a description of the job down to what to expect for that shift is right in your hands.  
- We also are trying to include information for things not gone over in training very much. Job bids. Vacation. Claims. How to use YES effectively. etc.
