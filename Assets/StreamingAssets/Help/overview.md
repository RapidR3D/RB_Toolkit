# Overview

** CONCEPT **

- A mobile guide for rail employees that explains each job, demonstrates everyday use of tools and procedures, and shares real-world operating notes contributed by guys that worked the job
- A tool for when you receive a call for that job you haven't worked in months, you type in the job number, and a description of the job down to what to expect for that shift is right in your hands.
- We also are trying to include information for things not gone over in training very much. Job bids. Vacation. Claims. How to use YES effectively. etc.
