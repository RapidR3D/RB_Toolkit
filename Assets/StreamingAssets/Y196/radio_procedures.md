## <color=#FF8C00>Operating Notes</color>

- You will jump on your power either in front of the Humptower crew room on the car shop lead, or...
- you will swap out on the crest. (Either is possible although in front of the crew room is more probable.)
- Do your RCO Tests as soon as you get on your power. **(See Test Selections, procedures for each test included)**
- Always use hump mode before beginning shove to the hill (first notch on the RCO box).
- Always cancel hump mode before leaving the crest or proceeding down into the bowl.
- There are 49 tracks in the bowl, in 7 groups of 7, numbered 1–49. Looking north, track 1 is far left and 49 is far right.
- **(Recommended)** 7 MPH through intermediate crossovers and when going through retarders down into the bowl. (**SEE NEXT LINE**)
- **(BY TIMETABLE)** *Switches in the yard are good for 15 mph and tracks are good for 15 mph
- Maximum 4 MPH with bell ON when on the PIT.
- If asked to hump R1 or R2, the cut may weigh more than 10,000 tons. In that case, put the first 5 cars on air.
- On long, heavy cuts, be careful coasting and then going back into 7 MPH; excessive force can break a knuckle.
- Coming south out of the yard, Main 1 is on the right and Main 2 is on the left.
- To reach the short crossovers, get onto the bridge on the southern side of the yard to get over the circuit.
- West Open Pocket goes back by the PIT under the overpass and provides access to the hump underpass.
- West Open South is to the left of R3 and has overhead lights on poles alongside it. This is a good reference for identifying tracks.
