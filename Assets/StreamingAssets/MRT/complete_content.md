<color=#FF8C00>**Service Exception:**</color>  
- Means the cars were not put on the work order, regardless of whether YES or MRT was used to create the work order
- **Full Service Exception** = none of the planned cars were put on the work order
- **Partial Service Exception** = a portion of the planned cars were put on the work order

<color=#FF8C00>**Work Order Exception:**</color>  
- Indicates car was applied during the work order build and exceptioned by crew using MRT

## <color=#FF8C00>Customer Switch Data - What Determines the Score</color>  

### <color=#20B2AA>CSD Measure Looks at Two Factors</color>  

<color=#FF8C00>**Makes:**</color>  
- Place, pull, in-plant, interchange delivery work on the snapshot reported and completed within the defined customer service window
<color=#FF8C00>**VS.**</color>  
<color=#FF8C00>**Misses:**</color>  
- Place, pull, in-plant, interchange delivery work on the snapshot that is not completed within the defined customer service window
- Place, pull, in-plant, interchange delivery work on the snapshot that is not completed due to a Railroad Reason exception

---

## <color=#FF8C00>Work Instructions</color>  

### <color=#20B2AA>Understanding Begin and End Points</color>  

Railcars have a Begin Point and an End Point:  
- **Begin point** = From Instruction: Where you got the car from, couple up to it, add it to the train
- **End point** = To Instruction: Where you take the car to, uncouple from it, and leave it

Begin & End Point Work Instructions are linked in SPT and on the Work Order.  

### <color=#20B2AA>Two Letter Abbreviations</color>  

To input Add Work on MRT, you must input both:  
1. Where you got the car from (origination point of car)  
2. Where you expect to leave it (destination point of car)  

#### Begin Point - From Instruction
- <color=#FF8C00>**PK:**</color> Pickup from Station (CSX yard or Intch)
- <color=#FF8C00>**PU:**</color> Pull from Customer

#### End Point - To Instruction
- <color=#FF8C00>**PL:**</color> Place at Customer (Spot)
- <color=#FF8C00>**SO:**</color> Set Out to Station (CSX yard)
- <color=#FF8C00>**DI:**</color> Deliver Interchange to another RR

<color=#FF8C00>**Help Desk:**</color> 800-243-7743 Tablets #2, MRT #4  
Call option #4 to report work you are not able to input on MRT  

---

## <color=#FF8C00>Terminology</color>  

### <color=#20B2AA>CSX Station Work at Yards/Terminals</color>  
- **PK** - Pickup (add to train to depart with from station)
- **SO** - Set Out (leave at station)
- **LC** - Pickup Equipment of Locomotives & EOTS, shows in separate destination tile of Work Order

### <color=#20B2AA>Customer Work at Industry</color>  
- **PU** - Pull (remove, take out of)
- **PL** - Place (spot into)
- **IP** - Intraplant Switch (move previously placed cars within the customer facility, stays in customer)

### <color=#20B2AA>Interchange Work</color>  
- **DI** - Deliver Interchange to other Railroads/Shortlines (take from CSX to designated RR track)
- **PK** - Pickup cars (received interchange from designated RR track to bring online to CSX network)

### <color=#20B2AA>Important Notes</color>  
Report work accurately with the correct time. It affects car cycles and plant switches, adds/removes cars from customer and yard inventory, and is used to charge the customer.  

We are not getting all of the customer place and pull events reported. Note the difference between pickup from station vs pull from customer, and the difference between set out at station vs place at customer.

## <color=#FF8C00>Load or Empty Status</color>  

### <color=#20B2AA>Load Categories</color>  
<color=#FF8C00>**Loads:**</color>  
- **L** - loaded
- **M** - company material loads
- **N** - nobill (loaded car with no billing in CSX systems or unknown L/E)

<color=#FF8C00>**Empties:**</color>  
- **E** - empty
- **F** - revenue empty

### <color=#20B2AA>MRT Input Rules</color>  
On MRT, you can only input L or E for the load/empty status. Cars will display the other statuses (M, N, F) to you. Leave them 'as is' unless you need to change the status from either loaded to empty or from empty to loaded.  

<color=#FF8C00>**Company Directive:**</color> Leave NOBILLS at the Customer until they are billed! Loaded PULLS must be on your work order or come through MRT New Work (don't add work them). It is ok to add work empty pulls from customer. You may need to change the L/E status.
