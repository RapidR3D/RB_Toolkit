## <color=#FF8C00>Frequently Asked Questions</color>  
<color=#FF8C00>**Q: How can I verify I input my claim?**</color>  
A: Two ways:  
1. Re-inquire on crewlife using the same information as reporting, or  
2. The day after reporting, log in to crew mainframe menu and select Option 4 – Print T&E Daily Claims.  
<color=#FF8C00>**Q: If I work different classes of service during the training week, should I submit multiple training pay claims under different classes or service?**</color>  
A: No, you should only have one training pay claim for the week. The training rate is the same for all classes of service. However, if worked even one yard assignment during the week, your training claims must be submitted under that subdivision code and yard code with Kind of Service 5 and Occupation Code as FO.  
<color=#FF8C00>**Q: I worked a yard job but don’t know the yard code. How can I find it?**</color>  
A: Under Payroll menu option, click on Yard Ticket tab > make sure Option is set to List > find the Job ID in the list and the yard code is the second column. If unable to find it there, ask your Manager.  
<color=#FF8C00>**Q: I worked a job but don’t see it in my T&E Classroom or Throttle Hours pop-up screen. Why not?**</color>  
A:  
1. You were not called for the job in TECS. Check your employee history to verify you have the call record. If you do not, you will not be able to report the job on the Throttle tab; this will not negatively affect your weekly training pay.  
2. If you do have call records in your work history, then you are not using the correct yard code. See Q&A above for how to find correct yard code.  
<color=#FF8C00>**Q: If I’m still having issues reporting pay, how can I contact Payroll for assistance?**</color>  
A: Three ways:  
1. Send an email to payroll@csx.com  
2. Create a self-service case online through Employee Self Service by going to: CSX Employee Gateway > Health, Pay & Benefits > Employee Self Service > Create New Case  
3. Call 1-800-633-4045, Monday – Friday, 8:30 AM – 3:30 PM.  
   * For options 1 & 2, if you include your phone number and request assistance with submitting training claims, someone from Payroll will call you to help.
