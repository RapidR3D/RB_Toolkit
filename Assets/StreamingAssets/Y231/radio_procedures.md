## <color=#FF8C00>Operating Notes</color>

- Queensgate may use you for a roustabout.
- If you have been on duty for 30 minutes and haven't heard anything, talk to the clerks to find out the plan for the day.
- Always ask permission before entering A or B to grab or set off a cut of cars.
- Make sure blue flags are down and locks or off before attempting to throw the switches into A or B.
- We are supposed to flag the road crossing shoving into A and B.
- Double check hand brakes and angle cocks on the south end.
- Before pulling make sure line up is good out the North End of the Ramp.
- You will need a signal at Hopple if you have to double A and B.
- Try not to leave a cut of cars in A track in the bend or it'll be a pain to couple back in to.
- Don't block the road crossing on either end without receiving permission from the Ramp Office.
- Be prepared to move a cut as soon as its been handled by the crane operators as they cannot add or remove cranes if the south end is blocked.
- It's best practice to always ride your shoves on the ramp (I'm living proof of this **Note: Jan. 11th, 2024).
- There are 6 tracks on the ramp plus *A and *B.
- *See pictures or table below for track lengths.
- 1 Track = 6100 ft.
- 2 Track = 6000 ft.
- 3 Track = 3000 ft.
- 4 Track = 2300 ft.
- 5 Track = 2400 ft.
- 6 Track = 2700 ft.
- A Track = 1900 ft.
- B Track = 2000 ft.
- North Lead = 2300 ft.
- South Lead = 2800 ft.

- Second shift has a tendency to work 12 hours, so be prepared.
