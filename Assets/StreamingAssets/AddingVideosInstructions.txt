HOW TO ADD VIDEOS TO THE APPLICATION
======================================

This guide explains how to add new video content to the application.

1. PREPARE THE VIDEO FILE
-------------------------
- The video must be in .mp4 format.
- Place the video file inside the "StreamingAssets" folder (or any subfolder within it).
  - Recommended location: "Assets/StreamingAssets/TrainingVideos/"
  - Example: "Assets/StreamingAssets/TrainingVideos/NewTrainingVideo.mp4"

2. UPDATE THE JSON DATA
-----------------------
- Locate the "job.json" file for the specific job or category where you want the video to appear.
  - Example: "Assets/StreamingAssets/Y197/job.json"
- Open the file in a text editor.
- Find the "sections" array.
- Add a new section entry for the video.

Format:
{
  "label": "Display Name of the Video",
  "file": "Path/To/Video.mp4"
}

IMPORTANT: The "file" path must be relative to the "StreamingAssets" folder.

Examples:
- If video is in "Assets/StreamingAssets/TrainingVideos/Intro.mp4":
  "file": "TrainingVideos/Intro.mp4"

- If video is in "Assets/StreamingAssets/Y197/Process.mp4":
  "file": "Y197/Process.mp4"

3. CODE CHANGES (OPTIONAL)
--------------------------
- No code changes are required to add videos to existing jobs or categories.
- The application automatically detects ".mp4" files in the JSON and treats them as videos.

Advanced: New Document Types
- If you are creating a completely new category (docType) in a new job.json file (e.g., "docType": "new_category"), and you want the Search Bar to be visible for this category:
  1. Open "Assets/Scripts/JobSearchUIController.cs".
  2. Find the "OnJobLoaded" method.
  3. Locate the boolean flags for docTypes (e.g., "bool isMainframe = ...").
  4. Add a flag for your new docType.
  5. Add your flag to the condition that shows the "SearchControlsContainer".

4. TROUBLESHOOTING
------------------
- Video not playing?
  - Check that the file path in job.json is correct and relative to StreamingAssets.
  - Ensure the file extension is exactly ".mp4".
  - Check the Unity Console for errors (e.g., "Video not found").
- Video plays but screen is black?
  - Ensure the video codec is supported by Unity (H.264 is recommended).
