# <color=#FFD700>How to Take an EC-1 Form</color>

## <color=#FF8C00>What is an EC-1?</color>

The EC-1 form is essentially a **form for movement**. It is used for:
- Movement on TWC-D territory (Dark Territory)
- Broken Defect Detectors
- Dispatcher messages

**Key Principle:** The Dispatcher tells you what to write in the applicable fields. You simply copy and repeat what they tell you. The Dispatcher expects everything repeated to be **exactly** what they have told and given—it is law.
