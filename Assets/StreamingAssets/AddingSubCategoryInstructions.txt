Here are the step-by-step instructions on how to add your own sub-categories to the project. This system allows you to nest folders as deep as you like.

Step 1: Create the Sub-Category Folder

1.  Navigate to the StreamingAssets folder in your project (Assets/StreamingAssets).
2.  Open the folder of the Parent Category where you want to add the sub-category (e.g., Miscellaneous).
3.  Create a New Folder inside it and name it whatever you want your sub-category to be (e.g., MyNewCategory).

Step 2: Create the Configuration File (job.json)

Every category needs a job.json file to tell the app what to display.

1.  Inside your new folder (Assets/StreamingAssets/Miscellaneous/MyNewCategory), create a new text file named job.json.
2.  Paste the following template into it and modify the values:

[language=json]
{
  "title": "My New Category",
  "docType": "my_new_category",
  "version": "1.0",
  "category": "General Info",
  "keywords": [
    "New",
    "Category",
    "Info"
  ],
  "sections": [
    {
      "label": "Overview",
      "file": "overview.md"
    }
  ]
}

• title: The name displayed at the top of the screen.
• docType: A unique internal ID (lowercase, no spaces).
• sections: The list of items (files or other sub-categories) to show in the menu.

Step 3: Add Your Content

1.  Create the content files you referenced in the sections list (e.g., overview.md).
2.  You can add Markdown files (.md), CSV tables (.csv), or Images (.png/.jpg).
3.  Example overview.md:
    [language=markdown]
    # Welcome
    This is the overview for my new sub-category.
    

Step 4: Link from the Parent Category

Now you need to tell the Parent Category to show a button for your new sub-category.

1.  Go back up to the Parent Folder (e.g., Assets/StreamingAssets/Miscellaneous).
2.  Open the Parent's job.json file.
3.  Add a new entry to the sections list pointing to your new folder's job.json.

Example modification to Miscellaneous/job.json:

[language=json]
  "sections": [
    {
      "label": "Overview",
      "file": "overview.md"
    },
    {
      "label": "Over The Road",
      "file": "OverTheRoad/job.json"
    },
    {
      "label": "My New Category", 
      "file": "MyNewCategory/job.json" 
    }
  ]

• Note: Ensure you add a comma , after the previous item in the list!

Step 5: (Optional) Add a Search Shortcut

If you want users to be able to type a shortcut like "NEW" in the main search bar to jump directly to this folder, you need to edit the code.

1.  Open Assets/Scripts/JobDataLoader.cs.
2.  Find the LoadJobFromInputField method (around line 280).
3.  Add a new else if block for your shortcut:

[language=csharp]
else if (upperInput == "NEW" || upperInput == "MY CATEGORY")
{
    // Path relative to StreamingAssets
    JobFolder = "Miscellaneous/MyNewCategory"; 
}


Summary of Structure

If you followed these steps, your file structure should look like this:

[language=text]
Assets/
└── StreamingAssets/
    └── Miscellaneous/
        ├── job.json          <-- Links to "MyNewCategory/job.json"
        └── MyNewCategory/    <-- Your new folder
            ├── job.json      <-- Defines the sub-category
            └── overview.md   <-- Your content
